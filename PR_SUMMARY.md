Title: chore: switch to Bun as package manager

Summary
- Switch project tooling from npm to Bun for faster installs and consistent local/dev/prod parity.
- Add `packageManager: "bun@1"` to `package.json` so platforms (e.g., Vercel) detect Bun.
- Remove `package-lock.json` and create `bun.lock` via `bun install`.
- Keep existing scripts the same (`dev`, `build`, `preview`, `test`).

Changes
- package.json: added `"packageManager": "bun@1"`.
- package-lock.json: removed to avoid mixed lockfiles.
- bun.lock: generated by `bun install`.
- CONTRIBUTING.md: documented Bun commands and guidance not to mix managers.

Rationale
- Bun provides significantly faster installs and good compatibility with Vite, Vitest, and Tailwind.

Build & Deploy
- Local build verified: `bun run build` succeeds and outputs to `dist/`.
- On Vercel (or similar), `packageManager` will prompt Bun usage (`bun install` + `bun run build`). No framework or command changes required.

Verification Done
- Install: `bun install` (creates bun.lockb)
- Dev: `bun run dev` (served on http://localhost:5173)
- Build: `bun run build` (successful; assets emitted to `dist/`)
- Optional: `bun run preview` to smoke-test production build locally

Manual QA Notes
- Launch dev and click through main flows:
  - Split bill, adjust items, verify per-person totals update
  - Navigate between routes; check no console errors
  - If using Supabase features, confirm `.env.local` contains `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Rollback Plan
- If any deployment issues arise:
  - Remove `packageManager` from `package.json`
  - Restore `package-lock.json` from main
  - Run `npm install` and rebuild

Commands Executed
- `bun install`
- `bun run build`
